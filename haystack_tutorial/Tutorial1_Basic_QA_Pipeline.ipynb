            "               <Document: {'content': '\\n===Overview===\\nKit Harington plays the role of Jon Snow in the television series.\\nMartin told \\'\\'Rolling Stone\\'\\' in 2014 that some early inquiries he received about adapting \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\' suggested identifying the story\\'s \"important character\" and focusing on that individual plot line: Jon and Daenerys Targaryen being the two most popular choices. Martin was not interested in sacrificing so much of the overall story. When the pilot for the HBO adaptation went into production years later, one of the first parts cast was Jon, with Kit Harington announced in the role in July 2009. Alfie Allen and Iwan Rheon had also auditioned for the role, and were brought into the show to play Theon Greyjoy and Ramsay Snow instead, respectively. In October 2014, Harington and several other key cast members, all contracted for six seasons of the series, renegotiated their deals to include a potential seventh season and salary increases for seasons five, six, and seven. \\'\\'The Hollywood Reporter\\'\\' called the raises \"huge\", noting that the deal would make the performers \"among the highest-paid actors on cable TV\". \\'\\'Deadline Hollywood\\'\\' put the number for season five at \"close to $300,000 an episode\" for each actor, and \\'\\'The Hollywood Reporter\\'\\' wrote in June 2016 that the performers would each be paid \"upward of $500,000 per episode\" for seasons seven and the potential eight. In 2017, Harington became one of the highest paid actors on television and will earn £2\\xa0million per episode for the show.\\nThe costumes of Ygritte, Jon Snow, and  Tormund Giantsbane in the show\\nAs the series premiered, \\'\\'TV Guide\\'\\' called Harington a \"soulful heartthrob\" whose Jon is idolized by his younger siblings and who \"seeks purpose\" by joining the Night\\'s Watch. Creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss later noted that Jon \"tries to live with honor, while knowing that honor often gets his family members murdered\". They explained that he is one of several characters in the series who must \"face hard truths about the world they live in, and adapt themselves to those truths. The struggle many of them face is how to do that without losing their grip on who they are.\" Matt Fowler of IGN wrote in 2013 that while Jon and Daenerys\\' storylines in season 1 and season 2 \"felt very separate\" from the rest of the series\\' plot, for the first time in season 3, \"Jon\\'s entire situation felt incorporated into the larger picture.\" Fowler also added that Jon\\'s \"oath-breaking romance with Ygritte added a lot of heat to the story\". In May 2015, \\'\\'International Business Times\\'\\' called Jon \"clearly the most popular character\" of the series.\\nIn a 2015 interview Benioff said, \"The problem with Jon is, he’s not a cautious man. It\\'s the problem with him, and also the reason we love him. He is a hero, but heroes are inherently incautious.\" Weiss added, \"At the end of the day, Jon is his father’s son, he’s a person who’s honorable to a fault and does the right thing even when the right thing is extremely dangerous to him personally.\" In the June 2015 season 5 finale \"Mother\\'s Mercy\", Jon is stabbed to death by Alliser Thorne and several men of the Night\\'s Watch after being labeled a traitor. With Martin\\'s 2011 novel \\'\\'A Dance with Dragons\\'\\' vague on Jon\\'s fate, Harington confirmed the character\\'s death in an interview with \\'\\'Entertainment Weekly\\'\\', saying \"I’ve been told I’m dead. I’m dead. I’m not coming back next season.\" He added, \"I loved how they brought the orphan boy Olly in to be the person who kills me. I love how the storyline with Thorne was wrapped up.\" Benioff also said of the episode:\\nWriting for \\'\\'The New York Times\\'\\', Jeremy Egner called Jon\\'s demise \"the biggest death on the show\" since Ned Stark\\'s beheading in season 1. Amid strong fan reaction over Jon\\'s death on social media, immediately following the episode journalists began theorizing how the show could resurrect the character. Nate Jones of Vulture.com noted:\\nA July 2015 sighting of Harington arriving in Belfast, a primary filming location for the series where other actors were arriving for season 6 script read-throughs, prompted further speculation about the character\\'s return. However, a story in \\'\\'Vanity Fair\\'\\' pointed out that Charles Dance had been seen in Belfast the previous year after his character Tywin Lannister\\'s death as well, and he only appeared in the first episode of the subsequent season as a corpse. Another photo that showed Harington on set in Belfast in a costume that varied from the Night\\'s Watch outfit was published on September 25, 2015.

In a subsequent interview with \\'\\'Entertainment Weekly\\'\\', Harington said:\\nJoanna Robinson of \\'\\'Vanity Fair\\'\\' credited Jon\\'s much-discussed cliffhanger death as a primary factor behind \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' subsequent 25% ratings increase for season 6.

Weiss discussed the decision to kill Jon Snow by saying that he felt the visual medium did not give him the freedom to leave Jon\\'s fate open: \"In a book, you can present that kind of ambiguity. In a show, everybody sees it for what it is. It’s that rule: \\'If we don\\'t see the body then they’re not really dead.\\' Like when we cut Ned’s head off, we didn’t want a gory Monty Python geyser of blood, but we needed to see the blade enter his neck and cut out on the frame where the blade was mid-neck. ... we needed Ned\\'s death to be totally unambiguous.\" Actor Kit Harington said of the scene, \"I loved it. I loved how they brought Olly in to be the person who kills me. I love how the storyline with Thorne was wrapped up.\"\\nAlthough Weiss meant the scene to be unambiguous, the episode left many viewers uncertain as to whether Jon Snow had been killed or merely injured (his fate in the novels is left unconfirmed as of \\'\\'A Dance with Dragons\\'\\', with much debate about Martin\\'s future intentions). Some of the confusion may be because, as reviewers have noted, Jon was killed in what can be seen as the middle of his story arc and his death does not have an obvious narrative purpose. For example, Nate Jones of \\'\\'Vulture\\'\\' notes, \"It\\'s easy to see what other characters\\' deaths meant for the series\\' sprawling narrative: Ned\\'s execution sent the Stark kids adrift in a universe where there was nobody looking out for them, while Robb\\'s murder was the final death knell for the hopes that the saga would ever have a traditional \\'happy\\' ending. What would be accomplished, narratively, by getting rid of Jon permanently right now?\" Both before and after these announcements, viewers have speculated that Jon Snow might have survived his stabbing and there are many fan theories on how he might have accomplished this, including spiritually possessing his direwolf\\'s body or being brought back to life by Melisandre. When jokingly asked during a panel if Kit Harington would ever get to play a warg (human who has possessed the body of an animal), Weiss replied with, \"Two words for you: Season 6.\" In July 2015, photos of Kit Harington arriving in Belfast—where the series is primarily filmed and where other actors are arriving for the Season 6 script read-throughs—surfaced, fueling speculation of his survival. However, Joanna Robinson of \\'\\'Vanity Fair\\'\\' pointed out that Charles Dance was seen at Belfast the previous year, and his character Tywin Lannister only appeared in the first episode of the subsequent season and only as a corpse, although Dance himself confirmed the nature of his role shortly after the announcement.

He had previously directed the fifth season episodes \"Kill the Boy\" and \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\".\\nIn an interview following the airing of the episode, Podeswa stated about the scene in which Jon Snow is resurrected; \"I think just establishing the right amount of tension through the scene, so you really didn\\'t know up until the last second which way it was going to go. That was the biggest thing, creating a sense of mystery and magic around the whole thing. We really wanted that scene to be very beautiful, but also fraught with tension. That\\'s the main thing we were looking for.\" Podeswa also compared how he shot the scene to \\'\\'The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp\\'\\' by Rembrandt, continuing, \"It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow\\'s body, really, but particularly the one where he\\'s resurrected.\" In another interview Podeswa described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting \"There was much discussion about what that actually was: There\\'s this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a big moment or a small moment.

Shortly after the wedding, Jeyne and Theon escape with the help of Mance Rayder. Jon Snow later receives a letter from Ramsay claiming that he has captured Mance and killed Stannis Baratheon (who was besieging Winterfell), threatening to destroy the Night\\'s Watch if Jon does not deliver Theon, Jeyne, and several other members of Stannis\\' court to Ramsay as captives.

Davos encourages Melisandre to attempt to resurrect Jon in \"Home\", and although the ritual at first seems to fail, Jon suddenly awakens. After hanging Thorne, Olly, Bowen Marsh, and Othell Yarwyck for their treason in \"Oathbreaker\", Jon gives command of the Watch to Edd and prepares to leave Castle Black. In \"Book of the Stranger\", he is reunited with his half-sister Sansa Stark, who has fled her abusive husband Ramsay Bolton and now seeks Jon\\'s aid in crushing the Boltons. Jon is hesitant until a threatening message arrives from Ramsay demanding Sansa\\'s return and announcing Ramsay\\'s possession of their brother Rickon. Jon, Sansa, Davos, Tormund, and Brienne of Tarth set off to recruit an army to take back Winterfell and rescue Rickon from Ramsay in \"The Broken Man\", but their forces grow to only half the size of Bolton\\'s. As the armies face each other in \"Battle of the Bastards\", Ramsay lures Jon away from his allies by forcing Rickon to run the gap between them, only to fatally shoot Rickon in the back before he can make it across. With Jon being separated from his forces, Ramsay\\'s army closes in on him, but Jon\\'s allies reach him in time. A devastating battle ensues in which the outnumbered Stark forces are nearly slaughtered, until the Knights of the Vale from House Arryn arrive with Sansa and Petyr Baelish, and attack the Bolton army from the rear.
